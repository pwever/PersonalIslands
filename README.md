# Personal Islands #

Personal islands uses data from GPS and Cellular towers to visualize a half year of my movements in and around Los Angeles. While not apparent to anybody but myself, the shape and topology of the island makes intuitive sense to me - the originator. Beyond the obvious (like the locations of my home and workplace or my preference of some neighborhoods over others), it acts a manifestation of the desire to explore and its conflict with daily rhythms and patterns.

The project does not include the data aggregation. Instead it focuses solely on the data visualization.
